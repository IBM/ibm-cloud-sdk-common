## Questions
If you are having problems using the APIs or have a question about IBM Cloud services,
please ask a question at
[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=ibm-cloud).

## Coding Style
The SDK follows the Go coding conventions documented [here](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html).
You can run the [linter](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) with the following command:
- `golangci-lint run`

## Commit Messages
Commit messages should follow the [Angular Commit Message Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines).
This is because our release tool - [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) -
uses this format for determining release versions and generating changelogs.
Tools such as [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) or [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint)
can be used to help contributors and enforce commit messages.
Here are some examples of acceptable commit messages, along with the release type that would be done based on the commit message:

| Commit message                                                                                                                                                              | Release type               |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `fix(resource controller): fix integration test to use correct credentials`                                                                                                 | Patch Release              |

## Pull Requests
If you want to contribute to the repository, follow these steps:  
  1. Fork the repository
  2. Develop and test your code changes:  
    - To build/test: `go test ./...`
  3. Please add one or more tests to validate your changes.
  4. Make sure everything builds/tests cleanly
  5. Commit your changes  
  6. Push to your fork and submit a pull request to the **master** branch

## Adding a new service

This section will guide you through the steps to generate the Go code for a service
and add the generated code to your SDK project.

1. Validate the API definition - before trying to process the API definition with the SDK generator, we strongly
recommend that you validate the API definition with the
[IBM OpenAPI Validator ](https://github.com/IBM/openapi-validator).
Example:
```
lint-openapi -s example-service.yaml
```
This command will display a list of errors and warnings found in the API definition
as well as a summary at the end.
It's not required that you fix all errors and warnings before trying to use the SDK generator, but
this step should identify any critical errors that will need to be fixed prior to the generation step.

2. **Recommended**: Modify your API definition to configure the `apiPackage` property.
The value of this property should be the module import path for your SDK project
(e.g. `github.com/IBM/platform-services-go-sdk`).
Here's an example:
```yaml
  info:
    x-codegen-config:
      go:
        apiPackage: 'github.com/IBM/platform-services-go-sdk'
```

By adding this configuration property to your API definition, you can avoid using the `--api-package`
command line option when running the SDK generator.

More details about SDK generator configuration properties can be found
[here](https://github.ibm.com/CloudEngineering/openapi-sdkgen/wiki/Config-Options).

3. Next, run the SDK generator to process your API definition and generate the service and unit test
code for the service.

You'll find instructions on how to install and run the SDK generator on the
[generator repository wiki](https://github.ibm.com/CloudEngineering/openapi-sdkgen/wiki/Usage-Instructions).

Set the output location for the generated files to be the root directory of the project.

If you did not configure the `apiPackage` configuration property in your API definition file(s), then
be sure to use the `--api-package <module-import-path>` command line option when running the SDK generator to
ensure that source files are generated correctly for your project.

Here is an example of how to generate the Go code for an API definition.
Suppose your API definition file is named `my-service.json` and contains the definition of the "My Service"
service.
To generate the code into your project, run these commands:
```sh
cd <project-root>

openapi-sdkgen.sh generate -g ibm-go -i my-service.json -o . --api-package <module-import-path>

```
The generated service and unit test code will be written to a **package** directory under your
project root directory that reflects the Go package name associated with the service.
For the example above, the package directory would be named `myservicev1`.  You should have a service
package directory for each of the services contained in your project, plus the `common` directory for
the "common" package.

4. Update the service table in the `README.md` file to add an entry for the new service.

5. Repeat the steps in this section for each service to be included in your project.

## Running tests
The tests within the SDK consist of both unit tests and integration tests.

### Unit tests
Unit tests exercise the SDK function with local "mock" service endpoints.

To run all the unit tests contained in the project:
- `go test ./...`

To run a unit test for a specific package within the SDK project:
- `cd <package-dir>` (e.g. `cd globalsearchv2`)
- `go test`

### Integration tests
Integration tests use actual service endpoints deployed in IBM Cloud, and therefore require the appropriate
credentials.

To run all integration tests contained in the project:
- Make sure you have provided the appropriate credentials for all the services
- `go test ./... -tags=integration`

To run the integration test for a single service:
- Make sure you have provided the appropriate credentials for the service being tested
- `cd <package-dir>` (e.g. `cd globalsearchv2`)
- `go test -tags=integration`

## Encrypting secrets
To run integration tests within a Travis build, you'll need to encrypt the file containing the
required external configuration properties.
For details on how to do this, please see [Encrypting Secrets](EncryptingSecrets.md).

## Questions
If you are having problems using the APIs or have a question about IBM Cloud services,
please ask a question at
[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=ibm-cloud).

## Coding Style
The SDK follows the Go coding conventions documented [here](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html).
You can run the [linter](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) with the following command:
- `golangci-lint run`

## Commit Messages
Commit messages should follow the [Angular Commit Message Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines).
This is because our release tool - [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) -
uses this format for determining release versions and generating changelogs.
Tools such as [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) or [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint)
can be used to help contributors and enforce commit messages.
Here are some examples of acceptable commit messages, along with the release type that would be done based on the commit message:

| Commit message                                                                                                                                                              | Release type               |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `fix(resource controller): fix integration test to use correct credentials`                                                                                                 | Patch Release              |
| `feat(global catalog): add global-catalog service to project`                                                                                                               | ~~Minor~~ Feature Release  |
| `feat(global search): re-gen service code with new v3 API definition`<br><br>`BREAKING CHANGE: The global-search service has been updated to reflect version 3 of the API.` | ~~Major~~ Breaking Release |

## Pull Requests
If you want to contribute to the repository, follow these steps:  
  1. Fork the repository
  2. Develop and test your code changes:  
    - To build/test: `go test ./...`
  3. Please add one or more tests to validate your changes.
  4. Make sure everything builds/tests cleanly
  5. Commit your changes  
  6. Push to your fork and submit a pull request to the **master** branch

## Running tests
The tests within the SDK consist of both unit tests and integration tests.

### Unit tests
Unit tests exercise the SDK function with local "mock" service endpoints.

To run all the unit tests contained in the project:
- `go test ./...`

To run a unit test for a specific package within the SDK project:
- `cd <package-dir>` (e.g. `cd globalsearchv2`)
- `go test`

### Integration tests
Integration tests use actual service endpoints deployed in IBM Cloud, and therefore require the appropriate
credentials.

To run all integration tests contained in the project:
- Make sure you have provided the appropriate credentials for all the services
- `go test ./... -tags=integration`

To run the integration test for a single service:
- Make sure you have provided the appropriate credentials for the service being tested
- `cd <package-dir>` (e.g. `cd globalsearchv2`)
- `go test -tags=integration`

## Encrypting secrets
To run integration tests within a Travis build, you'll need to encrypt the file containing the
required external configuration properties.
For details on how to do this, please see [Encrypting Secrets](EncryptingSecrets.md).

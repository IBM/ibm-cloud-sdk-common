## Questions
If you are having problems using the SDK or have a question about IBM Cloud services,
please ask a question at
[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask).

## Coding Style
This SDK follows a coding style based on the [Google Java coding style][GoogleJavaStyleGuidelines],
with the following modifications:
- Max line length is 120 chars
- Only basic JavadocStyle is enforced
- Import ordering is not enforced
- VariableDeclarationUsageDistance is not enforced
- OverloadMethodsDeclarationOrder is not enforced

## Commit Messages
Commit messages should follow the [Angular Commit Message Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines).
This is because our release tool - [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) -
uses this format for determining release versions and generating changelogs.
Tools such as [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) or [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint)
can be used to help contributors and enforce commit messages.
Here are some examples of acceptable commit messages, along with the release type that would be done based on the commit message:

| Commit message                                                                                                                                                              | Release type               |

## Adding a new service

This section will guide you through the steps to generate the Java code for a service
and add the generated code to your SDK project.

1. Validate the API definition - before trying to process the API definition with the SDK generator, we strongly
recommend that you validate the API definition with the
[IBM OpenAPI Validator ](https://github.com/IBM/openapi-validator).
Example:
```
lint-openapi -s example-service.yaml
```
This command will display a list of errors and warnings found in the API definition
as well as a summary at the end.
It's not required that you fix all errors and warnings before trying to use the SDK generator, but
this step should identify any critical errors that will need to be fixed prior to the generation step.

2. **Recommended**: Modify your API definition to configure the `apiPackage` property.
The value of this property should be the base package name associated with your
SDK project (e.g. `com.ibm.cloud.platform_services`).  All the generated service and model
classes for the project will be contained in packages whose names start with this base package name.
Here's an example:
```yaml
  info:
    x-codegen-config:
      java:
        apiPackage: 'com.ibm.cloud.platform_services'
```

By adding this configuration property to your API definition, you can avoid using the `--api-package`
command line option when running the SDK generator.

More details about SDK generator configuration properties can be found
[here](https://github.ibm.com/CloudEngineering/openapi-sdkgen/wiki/Config-Options).

3. Next, run the SDK generator to process your API definition and generate the service and unit test
code for the service.

You'll find instructions on how to install and run the SDK generator on the
[generator repository wiki](https://github.ibm.com/CloudEngineering/openapi-sdkgen/wiki/Usage-Instructions).

Set the output location for the generated files to be the `./modules` directory of the project.

If you did not configure the `apiPackage` configuration property in your API definition file(s), then
be sure to use the `--api-package <base-package-name>` command line option when running the generator to
ensure that source files are generated correctly.

Here is an example of how to generate the Java code for an API definition.
Suppose your API definition file is named `my-service.json` and contains the definition of the "My Service"
service.
To generate the code into your project, run these commands:
```sh
cd <project-root>

openapi-sdkgen.sh generate -g ibm-java -i my-service.json -o . --api-package <base-package-name>

```

The generated service and unit test code will be written to a **module** directory
underneath `./modules`.
The name of the module directory will reflect the service name.
For the example above, the module directory would be named `my-service`.
You will have one module directory underneath `./modules` for each service contained in your
project (plus the `common` and `coverage-reports` modules).

4. Copy the `service-pom.xml` file to `modules/<module-name>/pom.xml`, where `<module-name>` is
the name of the new module directory.
Edit this file and make these changes:
  - Replace `MODULE-ARTIFACTID` with the new module's artifactId (e.g. my-service)
  - Replace `MODULE-DESCRIPTION` with a suitable description for the module (e.g. "My Service").

5. Update the service table in the `README.md` file to add an entry for the new service.

6. Next, modify the parent `pom.xml` file to add an entry for the new service to the
`<modules>` element.

7. Repeat the steps in this section for each service to be included in your project.

## Running Tests
By default, when you run `mvn verify` (or `mvn package`), both unit and integration tests are run.

To run only the unit tests, run `mvn test -DskipITs=true`

To run the tests in a specific test class, use the `-Dtest` flag when invoking `mvn test`,
for example:  

```
mvn test -Dtest=SdkCommonTest
```

To run a specific test, add the name of the test method, for example:

```
mvn test -Dtest=SdkCommonTest#testGetSdkHeaders
```

## Encrypting secrets
To run integration tests within a Travis build, you'll need to encrypt the file containing the
required external configuration properties.
For details on how to do this, please see [Encrypting Secrets](EncryptingSecrets.md).

## Code Coverage
This repo uses [Jacoco][jacoco] to measure code coverage. To obtain a code coverage report, run `mvn clean verify`
from the root of the project, and then view the coverage report in the `modules/coverage-reports/target` directory:
```
open modules/coverage-reports/target/site/jacoco-aggregate/index.html
```

[jacoco]: https://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/

## Generating Javadocs
To generate the Javadocs for the project, run `mvn site` and then view the docs in the `target/site/apidocs` directory:
```
open target/site/apidocs/index.html
```
